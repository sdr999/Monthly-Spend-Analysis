# Monthly-Spend-Analysis
 I'm doing a little challenge to analyze my monthly expenses, using my bank statement for the past 12 months.
 I've been trying to find ways to save money and this is one way that I'm hoping will help me. I'm looking at what I'm spending regularly and where I can make changes.
 I'm also looking at ways I can save money by taking advantage of discounts and sales. 
 I'm hoping that by the end of this challenge I will have a better understanding of my finances and it will help me to make better financial decisions in the future.
